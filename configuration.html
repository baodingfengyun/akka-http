<p>Before configuring Akka HTTP it must be added to your project as described in <a href="introduction.html#using-akka-http">the introduction</a>.</p>
<p>在配置 Akka HTTP 之前，必需按 <a href="introduction.html#using-akka-http">导读</a> 描述的将它添加到你的项目里。</p>
<p>Just like any other Akka module Akka HTTP is configured via <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config">Typesafe Config</a>. Usually this means that you provide an <code>application.conf</code> which contains all the application-specific settings that differ from the default ones provided by the reference configuration files from the individual Akka modules.</p>
<p>就像其它 Akka 模块一样 Akka HTTP 是通过 <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config">Typesafe Config</a> 配置的。 通常，这意味着你应提供一个 <code>application.conf</code> 配置文件，其中包含所有应用程序特定相关的设置，这些设置与各 Akka 模块中的参考配置文件提供的默认值不同。 </p>
<p>These are the relevant default configuration values for the Akka HTTP modules.</p>
<p>这些是 Akka HTTP 模块的相关默认配置值。</p>
